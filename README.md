# PokemOnchain
Pokemon battling in 2D arrays on chain. Could eventually be used to make an NFT.

**WANT THIS IDEA FOR YOURSELF?**

Ask me on Twitter, if I haven't started it I'll probably give it to you.

DEV PROCESS

1) Clean up the dataset (remove forms and Mega and stuff)
2) Make a 2D array in Solidity, each Pokemon will battle by type comparison (max 2 type comparisons per tile)
3) Put all the pokemon into into an enum and see how bloated the contract gets (not very?)
4) Compare and battle pokemon in a 3x3 grid
5) Load up an NFT contract and make it mint the grid starting and ending positions as the result
6) Onchain rendering engine (?)

Probably a 3-4 day project!

This is for the future.
